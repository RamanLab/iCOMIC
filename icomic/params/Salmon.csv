Parameter,Value,Short description,Description,Default value,Essential
-p,INT,--threads,"The number of threads that will be used for quasi-mapping, quantification, and bootstrapping / posterior sampling (if enabled). Salmon is designed to work well with many threads, so, if you have a sufficient number of processors, larger values here can speed up the run substantially.",128,yes
--fldMax arg,INT,Maximum fragment Length,The maximum fragment length to consider when building the empirical distribution.,1000,no
--minAssignedFrags arg,INT,--minAssignedFrags,The minimum number of fragments that must be assigned to the transcriptome for quantification to proceed.,10,no
--biasSpeedSamp arg,INT,--biasSpeedSamp,"The value at which the fragment length PMF is down-sampled when evaluating sequence-specific & GC fragment bias.Larger values speed up effective length correction, but may decrease the fidelity of bias modeling results.",1,no
--fldMean arg,INT,--fldMean,The mean used in the fragment length distribution prior.,250,no
--fldSD arg,INT,--fldSD,The standard deviation used in the fragment length distribution prior.,25,no
-f arg,FLOAT,--forgettingFactor,"The forgetting factor used in the online learning schedule. A smaller value results in quicker learning, but higher variance and may be unstable. A larger value results in slower learning but may be more stable. Value should be in the interval (0.5, 1.0].",0.65,no
-m arg,INT,--maxOcc,MEMs occuring more than this many times won't be considered.,200,no
-w arg,INT,--maxReadOcc,"Reads ""mapping"" to more than this many places won't be considered.",100,no
--thinningFactor arg,INT,--thinningFactor,"Number of steps to discard for every sample kept from the Gibbs chain. The larger this number, the less chance that subsequent samples are auto-correlated, but the slower sampling becomes.",16,no
--numGibbsSamples arg,INT,--numGibbsSamples,Number of Gibbs sampling rounds to perform.,0,no
--numBootstraps arg,INT,--numBootstraps,Number of bootstrap samples to generate. Note: This is mutually exclusive with Gibbs sampling.,0,no
-x arg,INT,--quasiCoverage,"The fraction of the read that must be covered by MMPs (of length >= 31) if this read is to be considered as ""mapped"".  This may help to avoid ""spurious"" mappings. A value of 0 (the default) denotes no coverage threshold (a single 31-mer can yield a mapping).  Since coverage by exact matching, large, MMPs is a rather strict condition, this value should likely be set to something low, if used.",0,no
--vbPrior arg,FLOAT,--vbPrior,"The prior that will be used in the VBEM algorithm.  This is interpreted as a per-nucleotide prior, unless the --perTranscriptPrior flag is also given, in which case this is used as a transcript-level prior.",0.001,no
--rangeFactorizationBins arg,INT,--rangeFactorizationBins,"Factorizes the likelihood used in quantification by adopting a new notion of equivalence classes based on the conditional probabilities with which fragments are generated from different transcripts.This is a more fine-grained factorization than the normal rich equivalence classes.  The default value (0) corresponds to the standard rich equivalence classes, and larger values imply a more fine-grained factorization.  If range factorization is enabled, a common value to select for this parameter is 4.",0,no
-c,na,--consistentHits,"Force hits gathered during quasi-mapping to be ""consistent"" (i.e.co-linear and approximately the right distance apart).",na,no
--meta,na,--meta,"If you're using Salmon on a metagenomicdataset, consider setting this flag to disable parts of the abundance estimation model that make less sense for metagenomic data.",na,no
--dumpEq,na,--dumpEq,Dump the equivalence class counts that were computed during quasi-mapping.,na,no
-d,na,--dumpEqWeights,"Includes ""rich"" equivlance class weights in the output when equivalence class information is being dumped to file.",na,no
--fasterMapping,na,--fasterMapping,Disables some extra checks during quasi-mapping. This may make mapping a little bit faster at the potential cost of returning too many mappings (i.e. some sub-optimal mappings) for certain reads.,na,no
--reduceGCMemory,na,--reduceGCMemory,"If this option is selected, a more memory efficient (but slightly slower) representation is used to compute fragment GC content. Enabling this will reduce memory usage, but can also reduce speed. However, the results themselves will remain the same.",na,no
--discardOrphansQuasi,na,--discardOrphansQuasi,[Quasi-mapping mode only] : Discard orphan mappings in quasi-mapping mode. If this flag is passed then only paired mappings will be considered toward quantification estimates.  The default behavior is to consider orphan mappings if no valid paired mappings exist. This flag is independent of the option to write the orphaned mappings to file (--writeOrphanLinks).,na,no
--allowOrphansFMD,na,--allowOrphansFMD,"[FMD-mapping mode only] : Consider orphaned reads as valid hits when performing lightweight-alignment.  This option will increase sensitivity (allow more reads to map and more transcripts to be detected), but may decrease specificity as orphaned alignments are more likely to be spurious.",na,no
--seqBias,na,--seqBias,Perform sequence-specific bias correction.,na,no
--gcBias,na,--gcBias,[beta for single-end reads] Perform fragment GC bias correction.,na,no
--strictIntersect,na,--strictIntersect,"Modifies how orphans are assigned. When this flag is set, if the intersection of the quasi-mappings for the left and right is empty, then all mappings for the left and all mappings for the right read are reported as orphaned quasi-mappings.",na,no
--noLengthCorrection,na,--noLengthCorrection,Entirely disables length correction when estimating the abundance of transcripts.  This option can be used with protocols where one expects that fragments derive from their underlying targets without regard to that target's length (e.g. QuantSeq).,na,no
--noEffectiveLengthCorrection,na,--noEffectiveLengthCorrection,"Disables effective length correction when computing the probability that a fragment was generated from a transcript.  If this flag is passed in, the fragment length distribution is not taken into account when computing this probability.",na,no
--noFragLengthDist,na,--noFragLengthDist,"Don't consider concordance with the learned fragment length distribution when trying to determine the probability that a fragment has originated from a specified location. Normally, Fragments with unlikely lengths will be assigned a smaller relative probability than those with more likely lengths. When this flag is passed in, the observed fragment length has no effect on that fragment's a priori probability.",na,no
--noBiasLengthThreshold,na,--noBiasLengthThreshold,"If this option is enabled, then no (lower) threshold will be set on how short bias correction can make effective lengths. This can increase the precision of bias correction, but harm robustness. The default correction applies a threshold.",na,no
--perTranscriptPrior,na,--perTranscriptPrior,The prior (either the default or the argument provided via --vbPrior) will be interpreted as a transcript-level prior (i.e. each transcript will be given a prior read count of this value),na,no
--writeOrphanLinks,na,--writeOrphanLinks,Write the transcripts that are linked by orphaned reads.,na,no
