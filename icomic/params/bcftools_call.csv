-p,FLOAT, --pval-threshold  ,accept variant if P(ref|D) < float.,0.5,no
-P,FLOAT,Mutation rate,expected substitution rate  or 0 to disable the prior.,0.0011,no
-g,INT,--gvcf,output also gVCF blocks of homozygous REF calls. The parameter INT is the minimum per-sample depth required to include a site in the non-variant block,na,no
-n,FLOAT,--novel-rate,"likelihood of novel mutation for constrained -C trio calling. The trio genotype calling maximizes likelihood of a particular combination of genotypes for father, mother and the child P(F=i,M=j,C=k) = P(unconstrained) * Pn + P(constrained) * (1-Pn). By providing three values, the mutation rate Pn is set explicitly for SNPs, deletions and insertions, respectively. If two values are given, the first is interpreted as the mutation rate of SNPs and the second is used to calculate the mutation rate of indels according to their length as Pn=float*exp(-a-b*len), where a=22.8689, b=0.2994 for insertions and a=21.9313, b=0.2856 for deletions [pubmed:23975140]. If only one value is given, the same mutation rate Pn is used for SNPs and indels. ",,
