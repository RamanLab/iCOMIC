Variants where called following the `GATK best practices workflow`_:
Reads were mapped onto {{ snakemake.config["ref"]["name"] }} with `BWA mem`_, and both optical and PCR duplicates were removed with Picard_.
The GATK_ HaplotypeCaller was used to call variants per-sample, including summarized evidence for non-variant sites (GVCF_ approach).
Then, GATK_ genotyping was done in a joint way over GVCF_ files of all samples.
{% if snakemake.config["filtering"]["vqsr"] %}
Genotyped variants were filtered with the GATK_ VariantRecalibrator approach.
{% else %}
Genotyped variants were filtered using hard thresholds.
For SNVs, the criterion ``{{ snakemake.config["filtering"]["hard"]["snvs"] }}`` was used, for Indels the criterion ``{{ snakemake.config["filtering"]["hard"]["indels"] }}`` was used.
{% endif %}
Finally, SnpEff_ was used to predict and report variant effects.
In addition, quality control was performed with FastQC_, Samtools_, and Picard_ and aggregated into an interactive report via MultiQC_.
